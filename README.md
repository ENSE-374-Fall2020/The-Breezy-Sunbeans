# Proposed project
An application designed to connect users to new people. It will take your interests, location, and age as inputs and output other users with similar interests within restraints of distance and age

# Project background
Social interaction and group dynamics are a critical part of human society 

Covid-19 has substantially impacted the amount and quality of social interactions that occur as people have been social distancing 

This has had negative consequences as depression and suicide rates have hit all-time highs 

We want to encourage people to start making more friends and start being more social as this benefits individuals and the health of society as a whole 

The need to socialize remotely has never been greater

# Business need/opportunity
1.Make it easier for users to participate in social activities and improve their social skills by communicating with different people.

2. Help users find others with similar interests.

3. Give lonely, isolated people an opportunity to interact with others and form connections.
